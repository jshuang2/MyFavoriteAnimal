        <h1>My Favorite Animal!</h1>
            <p>
                My favorite animal is the penguin. I love penguins for multiple reasons. For one, they waddle. Simple as that -- they are inherently cute because they waddle.

                <br>

                The second reason why I love penguins is because of the movie Happy Feet. I already liked penguins before I watched the movie, but now I love them because I just imagine them dancing and talking. Unfortunately, that was just a movie.
